    <h2 class="left">Linear Equations</h2>
    <p>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form</p>
    <figure class="centr"><span class="form">ax + b = 0</span></figure>
    <p>
      where <span class="red">a</span> and <span class="red">b</span> are real
      numbers and <span class="red">x</span> is a variable. This form is
      sometimes called the standard form of a linear equation. Note that most
      linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may
      or may not be an <span class="red">x</span> so donâ€™t get too locked into
      always seeing an <span class="red">x</span> there.
    </p>
    <h2>Quadratic Equation</h2>
    <p>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</p>
    <figure class="centr">
      <span class="form">ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</span>
    </figure>
    <p>
      where <span class="red">a</span>,<span class="red">b</span>,<span
        class="red"
        >c</span
      >
      are known values and<span class="red">x</span> is the variable or unknown
      (we don't know it yet). Also, <span class="red">a</span> can't be 0.

    <h3 class="left">The area of a circle (A)</h3>
    <p>
      <span class="red">&pi;</span> (Pi) times the radius (<span class="red"
        >r</span
      >) squared:
    </p>
    <figure class="centr">
      <span class="form">A = &pi;xr <sup>2</sup> </span>
    </figure>
    <p>or, when you know the diameter (<span class="red">D</span>):</p>

    <figure class="centr">
      <span class="form">A = (&pi; / 4)x D<sup>2</sup> </span>
    </figure>
    <p>or, when you know the circumference (<span class="red">C</span>):</p>
    <figure class="centr">
      <span class="form"> A = C<sup>2</sup>/ 4x&pi; </span>
    </figure>
    <h2>Intersection</h2>
    <p>
      The intersection of two sets A and B, denoted by A [sign] B, is the set of
      all objects that are members of both the sets A and B. In symbols,
